# Unit 3: Implementing Routing in Single Page Applications (SPA)

This repository contains experiments based on **React Router DOM** to implement routing in a **Single Page Application (SPA)**.

---

## ✅ Experiment 3.1: Basic Client-Side Routing Using React Router

### 🎯 Aim
To implement basic client-side routing in a Single Page Application using React Router.

### 🛠️ Software Requirements
- Confirm Node.js
- React
- React Router DOM
- Web Browser

### 📖 Theory
Routing in a Single Page Application allows navigation between different views without reloading the page.  
React Router is a popular library used to handle client-side routing in React applications using components such as `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`.

### 🧪 Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Install `react-router-dom` package.
3. Wrap the application with `BrowserRouter`.
4. Define routes using `Routes` and `Route` components.
5. Navigate between pages without page reload.

### ✅ Output
Basic routing between pages/components using React Router.

## ✅ Experiment 3.2: Navigation Using Link Component

### 🎯 Aim
To implement navigation links in a SPA using React Router Link component.

### 📖 Procedure
1. Import `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
2. Create navigation links.
3. Enable smooth navigation.

### ✅ Output
Navigation between pages using routing links without refreshing the browser.

## ✅ Experiment 3.3: Multi-Page SPA Using Routing

### 🎯 Aim
To create a multi-page SPA using client-side routing.

### 🧪 Procedure
1. Create multiple components.
2. Map each component to a route.
3. Test navigation.

### ✅ Output
A multi-page SPA implemented using React Router with smooth navigation between pages.
