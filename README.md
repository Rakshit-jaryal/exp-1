📘 Experiment Descriptions
🔹 Experiment 1.1: SPA Counter

This experiment focuses on developing a simple Single Page Application (SPA) counter using React. The application allows users to increment and decrement a counter value using buttons. React state (useState) is used to manage and update the counter dynamically, demonstrating state management and re-rendering in React.
